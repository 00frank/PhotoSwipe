1.0.1 11.04.11
--------------
Major update:

- Fading of caption and toolbar more like iOS photo view by default.

- Individual settings of toolbar and caption consolidated into "captionAndToolbarHide, captionAndToolbarHideOnSwipe, captionAndToolbarFlipPosition, captionAndToolbarAutoHideDelay, captionAndToolbarOpacity, captionAndToolbarShowEmptyCaptions". This was done to simplify logic and reduce a timeout. Previous caption and toolbar settings are not longer valid.

- Fixed "zoom" for imageScaleMethod.

- Fixed issue where loop was set to false and slideshow was active.

- Fixed issue with placement of caption if at the bottom
